#Computerized Virtual Psychotherapy
###A Retrieval Conversation Model based on Eliza and Ellie

My project for CS199, Fall 2016. The goal was to create a primitive retrieval conversation model for basic psychotherapy. This model is built on top of Christina Cacioppo's [*Ellie*](https://github.com/christinac/ellie-slack) implementation of [*Eliza*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), an early conversation model created in the 1960s by MIT's Joseph Weizenbaum, [implemented in Python by Daniel Connelly](https://github.com/dhconnelly/paip-python/blob/master/paip/eliza.py). To honor the existing genealogy I will temporarily refer to my model as **El** (simulatenously tributing [Eleven](http://strangerthings.wikia.com/wiki/Eleven)). El will try to incorporate the 5 psycholinguistic features that were shown to predict therapy success, as noted in [Tim Althoff](http://www.timalthoff.com/), [Kevin Clark](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/kevclark/), and [Jure Leskovec](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/)'s [paper](http://timalthoff.com/docs/althoff-2016-mental_health.pdf) for Stanford's [Counseling Conversation Analysis Project](http://nlp.stanford.edu/blog/how-to-help-someone-feel-better-nlp-for-mental-health/).

Christina used the Slack Real Time Messaging API to bring Ellie to life. I, however, won't focus on the testing of El. Nevertheless, feel free to refer to her instructions found [here](https://github.com/christinac/ellie-slack/blob/master/README.md). 

Enjoy!

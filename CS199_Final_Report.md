#####Fall 2016
######Stage 1
I set my year-end goal as to create a minimal-working retrieval model for basic psychotherapy purposes. This model is built on top of Christina Cacioppo's Ellie implementation of Eliza, an early conversation model created in the 1960s by MIT's Joseph Weizenbaum. It will try to incorporate the 5 psycholinguistic features that were shown to predict therapy success, as noted in Tim Althoff, Kevin Clark, and Jure Leskovec's paper for Stanford's Counseling Conversation Analysis Project. I also decided on Crisis Text Line's Enclave Data as my primary source of data, chosen for its large corpus and robust structured-text data schema. I now divided my attention to 1) the retrieval model, and 2) the data application.

######Stage 2
The retrieval model had its basic backbone on Github, so I only needed to comprehend its core source code and revise it according to the linguistic features that I need to incorporate. In this stage, I performed an in-depth analysis of the paper by Althoff, Clark, and Leskovec, and decided on the manners in which I will manually embed the features that contributed to psychotherapy success (more on this in source code report). On the other hand, I coordinated

###Quarterly Summary


#####Activities & Accomplishments 
After meeting with fellow participants and mentors at the kickoff, I created a project pipeline and discussed it with my mentor, Dr. Eric Haseltine. At the same time, I enrolled in an independent research course under Professor Kleinrock, and discussed my project my research advisor, Professor Fabien Scalzo.

####Things I need to change:

-	   README.md : describe the IRI project, reference christina & stanford paper
-	   *remove* screenshot.png
-	   in /plugins/ellie:
	   -  for eliza.py
	      -	  optimize and enhance using NLTK preprocessing (Line 205 onwards)
	   -  for ellie.py
	      -	  "successful counselors are more sensitive to the current trajecory of the conversation and react accordingly" 
	      -	  "successful counselors **clarify** situations by writing more, reflect back to check understanding, and making their conversation partners more comfortable through affirmation"
	      -	  "successful counselors respond in a more creative way, not directly repeating the patients' words and not using generic, formatted responses
	      -	  "successful counselors are quicker to get to know the core issue and faster to move on to collaboratively solving the problem
	      -	  "perspective change"
	      - implement "hedges, check questions, and unique talk style (no coordination)
	   - for runner.py
	     	 - stay the same (delay is needed for realistic effect)
